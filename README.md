# Platonic Game

This project is an open source game with the modest goals of
1. Serving as a common reference for game development discussions
1. Helping the Godot 4.x develoment process by means of reproducing bugs

Its goal is not necessarily to be a compelling, fun game. But caring about fun
will help exercise the parts of Godot that developers often care about.

# Contributions

Contributions are certainly welcome. Anything that helps drive discussions
around development (especially Godot development) will be given serious
consideration, and likely be accepted. Contributions need not be thematically
consistent with existing content, but consider keeping separate themes in
their own scenes.
